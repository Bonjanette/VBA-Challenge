Module 2 work
There are 4 files:
  * A VBScript file containing the code I created. I did need to look up how to do several things, but I adapted them to my format. I consulted Microsoft and this page:      https://www.homeandlearn.org/excel_vba_practice3.html primarily
  * 3 screenshots, one for each year in the workbook
